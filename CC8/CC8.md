## How Each Solution Works:

### Problem 1 (Simple Value-Returning):
- **Main**: Gets radius input, calls calculation method, displays result
- **fdCalculateCircleArea()**: Takes radius parameter, returns calculated area using Math.PI

### Problem 2 (Enhanced Guessing Game):
- **Main**: Implements do-while game loop, tracks wins, handles input validation
- **fiGenerateSmartGuess()**: Uses bias factor to make computer guess closer to player's patterns, improving computer win rate
- **AI Research**: Includes comments about ChatGPT and Copilot consultation for enhancing odds

### Problem 3 (Captive Structure Refactoring):
- **Main**: Calls validation method, gets classification, displays results
- **fdGetValidGPA()**: Implements captive structure (do-while) for input validation, ensures GPA is in valid range
- **fsClassifyStudent()**: Helper method that classifies student based on GPA

### Problem 4 (Three Value-Returning Methods):
- **Main**: Orchestrates three input methods, performs calculations, displays formatted results
- **Three Child Methods**: Each handles specific input (diameter, cost, slices)
- **Helper Method**: Calculates pizza area using geometry

### Problem 5 (Cascading Methods):
- **Main**: Gets array of values, calls cascading methods, displays statistical analysis
- **fdCalculateMean()**: First child calculates average of values
- **fdCalculateStandardDeviation()**: Second child uses mean from first method to calculate standard deviation
- **Demonstrates**: Hand-me-down approach where output of first method feeds into second method

Each solution demonstrates proper refactoring principles, method design, and the progression from simple to complex method interactions while maintaining code readability and logical organization.
